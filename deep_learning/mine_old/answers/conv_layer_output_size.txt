the formula to calculate the output size (height\width):

O = 1 + (W-K+2P)/S

where:
O - output height\width
W - input height\width
K - kernel (or filter) height\width
P - padding
S - stride

the formula holds because the output size is basically the number of times we slide the kernel over the input.
the 1 at the start represents just placing the kernel at the start, this is worth 1 pixel.
W+2P is the size of the actual picture, and -K is because placing the kernel has already been considered.
so we're left with just the space that the kernel needs to go over, and this we divide in the stride 
(which is a positive, whole number).
