"""
a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem
- slot-machines selection:
        you have multiple slot-machines,
        each with a different win distribution,
        you want to find the one with the best (highest) distribution.
- ads selection: you're an advertiser, and you want to find the best ad.
        you have multiple ads,
        each with a different Clickthrough Rate (CTR) distribution (r_i(n) âˆˆ {0,1}),
        you want to find the one with the best (highest) distribution = Ads CTR Optimization.

this can also be solved with A/B testing (running an A/B test), which is pure exploration
        (you exploit all the options the same), which is less efficient.
